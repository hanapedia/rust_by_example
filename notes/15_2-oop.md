# Object oriented programming features of rust
## Using trait objects that allow for values of different types 
- sometimes we eant our library user to be able to extend the set of types that are valid in a prticular situation
### Defining a trait for common behavior
- a trait object points to both an instance of a type implementing our specified trait and a table used to look up trait methods on that type at runtime
  - they are more like objects in other languages as it combines data and behavior
```rust
pub trait Draw {
    fn draw(&self);
}

pub struct Screen {
    pub components: Vec<Box<dyn Draw>>, // vec of trait objects 
}

impl Screen {
    pub fn run(&self) {
        for component in self.components.iter() {
            component.draw();
        }
    }
}
```
- this defers from defining a struct that uses a generic type parameter with trait bounds.
- a generic type parameter can only be substituted with one concrete type at a time, where as trait object allow for multiple concrete types to fill in for the trait object at runtime
```rust
// with trait bounds
pub struct Screen<T: Draw> {
    // this vec can only consist of one concrete type
    pub components: Vec<T>,
}

impl<T> Screen<T>
where
    T: Draw,
{
    pub fn run(&self) {
        for component in self.components.iter() {
            component.draw();
        }
    }
}
```
### implementing the trait
- rust does not compile when you try to use types that does not implement the traits of the trait object
```rust
pub struct Button {
    pub width: u32,
    pub height: u32,
    pub label: String,
}

impl Draw for Button {
    fn draw(&self) {
        // code to actually draw a button
    }
}
struct SelectBox {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
    options: Vec<String>,
}

impl Draw for SelectBox {
    fn draw(&self) {
        // code to actually draw a select box
    }
}

fn main() {
    // vector can contain both button and SelectBox
    let screen = Screen {
        components: vec![
            Box::new(SelectBox {
                width: 75,
                height: 10,
                options: vec![
                    String::from("Yes"),
                    String::from("Maybe"),
                    String::from("No"),
                ],
            }),
            Box::new(Button {
                width: 50,
                height: 10,
                label: String::from("OK"),
            }),
        ],
    };

    screen.run();
}
```
### Trait objects perform dynamic dispatch
- trait boundaries generated functions for each concrete type that is used as generics parameter at compile time: *static dispatch*
- trait objects uses *dynamic dispatch* where the compiler emits code that at runtime will figure out which method to call, as the compiler does not know all the types used with the code that is using trait object
  - thus it costs some runtime performance overhead
