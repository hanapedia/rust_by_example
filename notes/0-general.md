- string literals are immutable and stored directly on stack
  - Also its value is hardcoded into the executable.
- String is mutable and is stored in the heap
  - its memory is requested at runtime and returned when done

## Scopes
- rust compiler can tell when the variable goes out of scope without reaching the end of the scope block.
