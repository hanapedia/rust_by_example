# Object-oriented programming features of rust 
- By some definition of oop, rust is object-oriented, but by some other, it is not
## Characteristics of Object-Oriented languages
- there is no consensus in the programming community about what features a language must have to be considered object-oriented.
- main characteristics shared by OOP languages include:
  - objects
  - encapsulation
  - inheritance
### Objects contain data and behavior
- "Object-oriented programs are made up of objects. An object packages both data and the procedures that operate on that data. The procedures are typically called methods or operations."
- if this definition is requirement for oop, Rust meets this requirement as it has `struct` and `enum` to hold data and `impl` to implement methods
### Encapsulation that hides implementation details
- Rust encapsulate the internal implementation as the modules and parts of the modules are both private by default
```rust
pub struct AveragedCollection {
    list: Vec<i32>,
    average: f64,
}
impl AveragedCollection {
    pub fn add(&mut self, value: i32) {
        self.list.push(value);
        self.update_average();
    }

    pub fn remove(&mut self) -> Option<i32> {
        let result = self.list.pop();
        match result {
            Some(value) => {
                self.update_average();
                Some(value)
            }
            None => None,
        }
    }

    pub fn average(&self) -> f64 {
        self.average
    }

    fn update_average(&mut self) {
        let total: i32 = self.list.iter().sum();
        self.average = total as f64 / self.list.len() as f64;
    }
}
```
- `AverageCollection` is public but its fields aren't, meaning they are encapsulated
- methods for `AverageCollection` consists of those that are public or private
### Inheritance as a type system and as code sharing
- inheritance is a mechanism whereby an object can inherit elements from another object's definition, thus gaining the parent object's data and behavior without you having to define them again
- there is no way in rust to define a struct that inherits the parent struct's fields and method implementations without using a macro.
- but rust has other solutions for some of the reasons why you want to use inheritance
1. reuse of code
  - where you want to reuse some behavior implemented on one type with different type
  - trait methods implementation in rust allows you to implement particular behavior and make it available across multiple types
2. type system
  - when you want to enable a child type to be used in the same place as the parent type. also known as *polymorphism*
  - rust uses generics to abstract over different possible types and trait bounds to impose constraints on what those types must provide, which is sometimes called *bounded parametric polymorphism*
- inheritance has recently fallen out of favor as a programming design solution in many programming languages because it's often at risk of sharing more code than necessary.
  - makes program inflexible 
  - introduces possibility of calling methods on subclasses that don't make sense or cause error 
- thus rust take different approaches
