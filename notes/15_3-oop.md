# Object Oriented programming features of rust
## Implementing an Objected-oriented design pattern
- the state pattern is an object-oriented design pattern
- the crux of the pattern is that we define a set of states a value can have internally.
- the staes are represented by a set of state objects and the value's behavior changes based on its state
- the advantage of using state pattern is that when the business requirements of the program cahnge, we don't need to cahnge the code of the value holding the stat or the code that uses the value.
  - we'll only need to update the code inside one of the state objects to change its rules or perhaps add more state objects

### example blog post application functionalities
1. A blog post starts as an empty draft 
2. When the draft is done, a review of the post is requested
3. When the post is approved it get published
4. Only published blog posts return content to print, so unapproved posts can't accidentally be published 

- implemented in ../oop-state-pattern/

### trade-offs of the state pattern
- if we were to implement the same application using enum, you'd have to use `match` statement for each methods where its arms represent each state
- one downside to using state pattern is that the state handles the state transfer, meaning that they are tightly coupled
- another downside is the duplicated logics

### encoding states and behavior as types
- following the exact defintion of state pattern does not allow you to levarage the full capability of rust compiler
- implemented in ../rust-state-pattern/

## Summary
An object-oriented pattern won't always be the best way to take advantage of Rust's strength, but is an available option
